## About
Chipster8 was built in C#9 and .NET 5 using MonoGame 3.8 with the multi-platform OpenGL template, making it available to run on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

It has the following features:
- Increase/decrease emulation speed
- Multiple color schemes
- Pause/Resume

The Chip8 emulator and application are separated such that one could pull out the Chip8 and re-use it in another way.
